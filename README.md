# intro-to-programming
 
## Hello, and welcome. 
### My name is Catherine, aka **Cat**
### I am a student at **Southwest Tech** studying **Software Development**.
##### I was president of Cyber Corps at Cedar High School, where I decided I wanted to be a programmer. I enjoy technology, and want to be the very best I can be at any given task. Sometimes we struggle, but it's all about how we get back up. 
##### When I decided I wanted to be a programmer, I checked out STECH and decided it was a good fit. I hope that I gain the proper skills to work with my uncle at his company and maybe make it up the ranks.
